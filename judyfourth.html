<h3>Perfect daughter who plays with her dad</h3>

<p>This was my first time to going abroad only <strong>with <u>my dad</u></strong>.
I was not interested in Mongolia before, but I'm sure it became my favorite country.</p>
<p>The vast, rolling steppes stretched out before us, an endless sea of green under 
the open Mongolian sky. I could feel the excitement bubbling within me as I 
prepared to embark on a journey like no other, accompanied by my dad, 
my partner in this adventure.</p>
<p style="margin-top:30px"><strong>Introducing Mongolia</strong><br>  Nestled between the towering expanse of Russia and 
    the ancient wonders of China lies Mongolia, a land of incredible contrasts. 
    From the rugged Altai Mountains to the sprawling Gobi Desert, this country 
    is a tapestry of untamed beauty and rich history.</p>
